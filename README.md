# Object Oriented Programming (contd..) - DRY coding principle
- 4 Pillars of OOP
- all these pillars promote code reuseability

## Encapsulation
- Technique of keeping internal state of object hidden from the outside.
- Achieved using private attributes and providing public methods to access and update them.
- Syntax: __varname (double underscore)

## Abstraction - something that isn't directly visable
- Concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object.
- Achieved by using Abstract class and method.

### Abstraction Class and Method


## Inheritance
- Mechanism of creating a new class based on an existing class, by inheriting properties (attributes and/or methods)
- Parent Class: The class from where the features are inherited from.
- Child Class: The class that inherits the features.
- Benefits: Classes are created easily, easy maintanence.


## Polymorphism
- Ability to present the same interface for different data types.
- Allows methods to do different things based on the objects it is acting upon
